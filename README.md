# MOLEK-SYNTEZ Solitaire solver

So far this is just a basic playable command line version of the solitaire.
The first attempt naturally kills my computer whenever I try to run it cuz I suck at coding tree searches.
Maybe I'll try something later on.

Get the game on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1168880/MOLEKSYNTEZ/)
