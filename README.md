# MOLEK-SYNTEZ Solitaire solver

So far this is just a basic playable command line version of the solitaire.
It actually works now, there were just some oversights that caused infinite loops but the concept was correct.
Such a me mistake. Anyway, next I'll see how hard/easy it is to grab screenshots, determine positions, emulate clicks, etc.
